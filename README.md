# Simulation of retinal hemodynamics

This code corresponds to our project on simulation of the retinal hemodynamics.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository using git.
2. Open MATLAB and move to the root folder of the repository.
3. Run ```setup```in the MATLAB console to add the folder to the path.

## Data preparation

We used publicly available data sets for running our experiments. In order to set up the data in a proper way, you can use some of the scripts in the ```data-preparation``` folder.

- ```script_setup_rite_data```: downloads the [RITE dataset](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/eye/rite-dataset) and generates folders for arteries and veins.
